    "People across the country, involved in government, political, and social activities, are dedicating their time to make the ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ (Developed India Resolution Journey) successful. Therefore, as a Member of Parliament, it was my responsibility to also contribute my time to this program. So, today, I have come here just as a Member of Parliament and your ‘sevak’, ready to participate in this program, much like you.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our country, governments have come and gone, numerous schemes have been formulated, discussions have taken place, and big promises have been made. However, my experience and observations led me to believe that the most critical aspect that requires attention is ensuring that the government’s plans reach the intended beneficiaries without any hassles. If there is a ‘Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana’ (Prime Minister’s housing scheme), then those who are living in jhuggis and slums should get their houses. And he should not need to make rounds of the government offices for this purpose. The government should reach him. Since you have assigned this responsibility to me, about four crore families have got their ‘pucca’ houses. However, I have encountered cases where someone is left out of the government benefits. Therefore, I have decided to tour the country again, to listen to people’s experiences with government schemes, to understand whether they received the intended benefits, and to ensure that the programs are reaching everyone as planned without paying any bribes. We will get the real picture if we visit them again. Therefore, this ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ is, in a way, my own examination. I want to hear from you and the people across the country whether what I envisioned and the work I have been doing aligns with reality and whether it has reached those for whom it was meant.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is crucial to check whether the work that was supposed to happen has indeed taken place. I recently met some individuals who utilized the Ayushman card to get treatment for serious illnesses. One person met with a severe accident, and after using the card, he could afford the necessary operation, and now he is recovering well. When I asked him, he said: “How could I afford this treatment? Now that there is the Ayushman card, I mustered courage and underwent an operation. Now I am perfectly fine.”  Such stories are blessings to me.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bureaucrats, who prepare good schemes, expedite the paperwork and even allocate funds, also feel satisfied that 50 or 100 people who were supposed to get the funds have got it. The funds meant for a thousand villages have been released. But their job satisfaction peaks when they hear that their work has directly impacted someone’s life positively. When they see the tangible results of their efforts, their enthusiasm multiplies. They feel satisfied. Therefore, ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ has had a positive impact on government officers. It has made them more enthusiastic about their work, especially when they witness the tangible benefits reaching the people. Officers now feel satisfied with their work, saying, “I made a good plan, I created a file, and the intended beneficiaries received the benefits.” When they find that the money has reached a poor widow under the Jeevan Jyoti scheme and it was a great help to her during her crisis, they realise that they have done a good job. When a government officer listens to such stories, he feels very satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are very few who understand the power and impact of the ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’. When I hear people connected to bureaucratic circles talking about it, expressing their satisfaction, it resonates with me. I’ve heard stories where someone suddenly received 2 lakh rupees after the death of her husband, and a sister mentioned how the arrival of gas in her home transformed her lives. The most significant aspect is when someone says that the line between rich and poor has vanished. While the slogan ‘Garibi Hatao’ (Remove Poverty) is one thing, but the real change happens when a person says, “As soon as the gas stove came to my house, the distinction between poverty and affluence disappeared.\n",

The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should em power the \\nfarmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green re volution.

His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people  and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely damaged. \\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. The villagers apprised me of \\ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations \\nalong with state government. I appreciate the courage of the people of Urusa in defeating \\ntheir problems. They have actually become the master of the probl em rather than \\nallowing problems to become their master.

During the last \\nfive years, I had an opportunity to present colours to many regime nts, participate in \\nnumber of passing out parades, meet the troops who were going to undertake  peace \\nmissions and interact with the family members of our Defence F orces. Our Defence \\nForces are in a beautiful mission. When the nation sleeps during night , Members of our \\nDefence teams are awake to guard us and remain vigilant to counte r any threat. The \\nNation cherishes the valour, commitment and devotion to duty of our Defenc e Forces. \\nSimilarly, I had opportunities to interact \\nwith members of our para-military forces, central and state poli ce personnel including \\ninternal security forces who are making immense contribution in au gmenting the safety \\nand security of our citizens under difficult conditions. \\n \\nYouth movement for Developed India 2020 \\nRecently, in Hyderabad, I met a group of citizens who are putting i nto practice the motto \\nof transforming of our youth into enlightened citizen.

The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

During the last \\nfive years, I had an opportunity to present colours to many regime nts, participate in \\nnumber of passing out parades, meet the troops who were going to undertake  peace \\nmissions and interact with the family members of our Defence F orces. Our Defence \\nForces are in a beautiful mission. When the nation sleeps during night , Members of our \\nDefence teams are awake to guard us and remain vigilant to counte r any threat. The \\nNation cherishes the valour, commitment and devotion to duty of our Defenc e Forces. \\nSimilarly, I had opportunities to interact \\nwith members of our para-military forces, central and state poli ce personnel including \\ninternal security forces who are making immense contribution in au gmenting the safety \\nand security of our citizens under difficult conditions. \\n \\nYouth movement for Developed India 2020 \\nRecently, in Hyderabad, I met a group of citizens who are putting i nto practice the motto \\nof transforming of our youth into enlightened citizen.

      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker discusses the aspirations of India's youth to live in a prosperous, safe, and proud nation. The speaker also highlights the importance of empowering villages, citing a visit to a village in Nagaland where they saw a successful village council functioning with financial powers and taking decisions. The speaker believes that empowering all 600,000 villages in India can lead to significant transformation and growth. Additionally, the speaker mentions an initiative by Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women, which aims to provide urban amenities in rural areas through provision of physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivity, leading to economic connectivity and job creation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is praising the success of the Periyar PURA project, which has created employment opportunities and entrepreneurial ventures through the support of 1000 self-help groups. The project has transformed 200 acres of wasteland into cultivable land, allowing villagers to grow crops like Jatropha, herbal, and medicinal plants, as well as generate power using biomass. The villagers have also established marketing centers and are involved in food processing. The project has also collaborated with Japanese experts to develop 55 internationally competitive products, enhancing the innovative abilities of the villagers. The speaker believes that this model has the potential to bridge the rural-urban divide and recommends establishing 7000 similar PURA projects across the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares two enriching experiences. Firstly, they met over 6,000 farmers from across India who showed great interest in the various gardens at Rashtrapati Bhavan, including Mughal, Herbal, Spiritual, Musical, Bio-diesel, and Nutrition gardens. They also interacted with horticulturists. The speaker emphasizes the importance of agriculture in India's economy and suggests that they need to double agricultural production while reducing land, water, and manpower. They believe that empowering farmers to protect and nurture land can lead to a second green revolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, the speaker recounts a beautiful experience they had with Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, a person who was born without hands and legs, but had a radiant smile and a happy state of mind. Despite his physical limitations, he was confident and grateful for the help he had received from others. When asked what the speaker could do for him, he replied that he just wanted to sing in front of them. The speaker is inspired by Vidwan's story and emphasizes the importance of confidence, training, and help in overcoming challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be about the importance of overcoming challenges and finding inspiration. The speaker shares two personal anecdotes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. They recall a person with physical disabilities who sang melodiously, showcasing his talent despite his limitations. This demonstrates that with a positive attitude and perseverance, people can overcome their challenges and share their gifts with others.\n",
      "2. The speaker shares their experience visiting Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir after the devastating 2005 earthquake. Despite the severe damage and losses, the villagers had a spirit of resilience and determination, and had become the \"master of their problem\" rather than allowing it to control them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech seems to be encouraging people to find inspiration in the face of adversity, and to recognize the importance of partnership and teamwork in overcoming challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is reflecting on their experiences with courage in the face of calamities. They recall visiting a village affected by an earthquake, where they saw children and villagers participating in relief efforts with the Armed Forces, and even interacting with the Chief Justice of Jammu & Kashmir to settle relief grants. The speaker also remembers visiting a village in Car Nicobar Islands after the 2004 Tsunami, where they were touched by the courage and resilience of the tribal islanders who had taken in affected victims as their own, without creating orphanages. The speaker composed a poem called \"Sea Waves\" with the locals, which expressed their courage and determination to overcome challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker proposed the concept of a Pan African e-Network, a high-speed internet network connecting 53 African countries at a cost of $100 million. The network will connect 12 universities, 17 hospitals, and 53 tele-medicine and tele-education centers across Africa. The project aims to provide seamless communication and access to education and healthcare services. A pilot project has already been launched in Ethiopia, connecting Ethiopian students with Indian universities and hospitals, and a tele-medicine project has been commissioned, allowing specialists from India to consult with patients in Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker mentions that India has been providing tele-consultation services to doctors in Ethiopia's Black Lion Hospital since 2006, connecting African leaders through the Pan African network. The speaker expresses pride in India's technology-driven efforts to bring about societal transformation in Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker then shifts focus to the country's defense forces, highlighting their bravery and commitment to duty. They recall visiting various military institutions, meeting with troops, and interacting with families of defense personnel. The speaker praises the defense forces for their vigilance and dedication to protecting the nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the speaker talks about the \"Youth Movement for a Developed India 2020\", mentioning a group of citizens in Hyderabad who are working to transform youth into enlightened citizens. The speaker does not provide further details about the movement, but seems to be encouraging young people to take an active role in building a better India.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is talking about the importance of transforming India's youth into enlightened citizens. They mention the Lead India 2020 Foundation, which is training thousands of students in Andhra Pradesh in partnership with the district administration.

They also share a personal story of a student who changed her father's behavior after attending a training camp. The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of empowering India's 540 million youth below the age of 25 through value-based education and leadership, and highlights the richness and diversity of India's culture and tradition.\n",
      "\n",

      "The speaker outlines five key goals for achieving this vision:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. A reduction in the urban-rural divide\n",
      "2. Equitable access to energy and clean water\n",
